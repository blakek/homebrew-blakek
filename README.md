# homebrew-blakek

> üç∫ Homebrew tap for my scripts

## Usage

After you install [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), run the following command in
your terminal:

```bash
brew tap blakek/blakek
```

You can now install any scripts found in this repo:

```bash
brew install pomodoro
```

**NOTE:** I try to use names not found in the standard Homebrew list. However,
in the case of a naming collision, use the scoped formula name. For example:

```bash
brew install blakek/blakek/pomodoro
```
